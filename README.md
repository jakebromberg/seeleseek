## Development

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16+ (Swift 6)

### Architecture
The core networking and protocol implementation lives in a local Swift Package at `Packages/SeeleseekCore/`. The app target imports this package and adds UI-specific extensions.

- **SeeleseekCore** — Protocol encoding/decoding, server/peer connections, download/upload management, models
- **seeleseek** — SwiftUI app, feature states, design system, database layer

### Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `seeleseek.xcodeproj` (the local package resolves automatically).

### Build
Run `xcodebuild` or use Xcode.

### CI/CD
GitHub Actions is configured to build and release the app on push to `main`.
